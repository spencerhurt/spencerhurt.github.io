            While many cultures have different names for this mountain, Neníisótoyóú’u is the name given by the Arapaho.
            Fields such as the Earth sciences are deeply rooted in the colonialization and exploitation of indigenous peoples and their land. I 
            firmly believe that research and everyday life can benefit from indigenous knowledge and practices (recommended reading

            at the bare minimum, we can return geographical features their indigenous names in an effort to recognize the histories of these 
            places.</span> <i>in Rocky Mountain NP.</i>

    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>
      I am an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> in the 
      <a href="https://earthsciences.uoregon.edu">Department of Earth Sciences</a>
      at the University of Oregon (located on the traditional homeland of the Kalapuya people). Here, I work with <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/jdufek/">
      Dr. Josef Dufek</a> to study the physics of volcanic eruptions. I am particularly 
      interested in the chemical and microphysical processes that control the transport of 
      sulfur compounds through volcanic plumes and the implications for subsequent climate 
      forcing. In May of 2022, I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from CU Boulder, where
      I studied astrophysics and planetary science as a <a href="https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/">
      Goldwater</a> and <a href="https://astronautscholarship.org">Astronaut</a> Scholar. 
      During this time, my research focused on the detection and characterization of
      exoplanet systems.

        West Slope, best slope! Not only is my hometown of Fruita, Colorado, set near stunning mesozoic rock units,
        dramatic fault lines, and an enchanting high desert ecosystem, but some pretty cool fossil finds were made

          Klah Klahnee is commonly cited as the indigenous name for the Three Sisters, presumably coming from the local Warm Springs tribe;
          however, few sources confirm the origin of the name. In this image, taken from Little Belknap Crater, the two northernmost peaks 
          can be seen with Collier Glacier extending from the saddle between. Both volcanoes last erupted in the Pleistocene while the basalt 
          flows in the foreground are among Oregon's youngest volcanic deposits, having formed in the 3,000 years. </span>.

        My research combines computational modeling with fieldwork and laboratory experiments to understand 
        the chemical and microphysical processes that control the formation and transport of sulfur compounds
        in volcanic plumes. When eruptions deliver large amounts of sulfate aerosols to the stratosphere, 
        they often remain suspended for long timescales and reflect sunlight, causing the Earth's surface
        to cool. This climate forcing can be both dramatic and sudden; in extreme cases, it may be catastrophic on 
        a global scale. Understanding what conditions enable the transport of sulfate aerosols is critical
        when preparing for and responding to these wide-spread, long-term hazards.

        While at CU Boulder, I worked with <a href="https://casa.colorado.edu/~mema5817/">Dr. Meredith MacGregor</a> 
        to model high-resolution images of circumstellar debris disks taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter
        Array (ALMA). These disks form from colliding planetesimals—the remnants of planet formation—and provide valuable
        information about the dynamical evolution of a planetary system. I led the modeling of HD 53143, which is currently
        the most eccentric (non-circular) debris disk known to date<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
        type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle left" /><span class="sidenote left">The resulting paper was featured in a press conference
        at the 240th meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/alma-debris-disk-hd53143/">
        a press release by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)</a>.</span>. Additionally, my senior thesis measured the alignment
        between debris disks and their host stars, helping understand which mechanisms misalign planetary orbits with their star's rotation axes.
        This work was recognized by the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences with the Theodore Snow Scholarship, awarded to 
        the graduating student with the best honors thesis.

        the fourth closest stellar system to Earth. During this time, I also maintained and added functionality to 
        <a href="https://radvel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><samp>RadVel</samp></a>, a popular Python package used to model radial-velocity time series and search for exoplanets.

      I previously volunteered with the <a href="https://grandmesaobservatory.com/">Grand Mesa Observatory</a>, located 
      near my hometown in western Colorado. Here, I helped organize stargazing events and public talks while maintaining
      and operating equipment. I also organized an observational astronomy and data analysis curriculum to give local 
      high school students a hands-on introduction to scientific research and computer programming. While at CU Boulder, 
      I also regularly ran virtual open-house nights at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sbo/">Sommers-Bausch Observatory</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As my research transitions to volcanology and the Earth sciences, I hope to focus on additional outreach and service. 
      I am particularly interested in efforts to decolonize the geosciences and making field work and research accessible
      to people with disabilities.

    <p>
      I use a small-aperture (250 mm focal length) telescope and specialized monochrome camera to take images of the night 
      sky. Most of my pictures can be found on <a href="https://www.astrobin.com/users/shurt/">AstroBin</a>, where plate-solved 
      versions are also available. I've included some of my favorites below.
